An SVG Icon can be easily included using the syntax `<i data-vi="icon-name"></i>` , where `icon-name` is replaced by the unique name of the respective icon.

### Example Code

<i data-vi="doc"></i>
```

To customize the size of the respective icon, Add `data-vi-size="number"` data attribute to `i` element to customize size of the icon.

### Example Code
```html
<i data-vi="doc" data-vi-size="96"></i>
```

## Customizing Icon Colors
Each Vivid Icon has upto three colors which are `primary`, `accent` and `prop`. Each color can be customized respectively using data attributes.

Add `data-vi-primary="#hexcode"` data attribute to customize the primary color of the icon.

Add `data-vi-accent="#hexcode"` data attribute to customize the accent color of the icon.

Add `data-vi-prop="#hexcode"` data attribute to customize the prop color of the icon.

### Example Code
```html
<i data-vi="doc" data-vi-primary="#2B13C1" data-vi-accent="#00ECB1" data-vi-prop="#CEFAFF"></i>
```

# Icon Customization
Oh! Yes, You can customize the default size and colors of the `Vivid.JS` SVG Icons Library.

### Install Node.js
First of all you need to [install the latest version of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (if you don't have it pre-installed), once you are over with Node.js installation, open up terminal and verify everything has setup correctly by running `npm -v` and it should return with something like `5.x.x`

### Create your Project
* Open terminal and create your project directory with `mkdir project-name` command.
* Go to your project directory using `cd project-name` command.
* Initialize your project by `npm init` command and enter the necessary details.

### Install Vivid.JS Package
Install Vivid.JS SVG Icons Package with npm package manager using the command below -
```cli
npm install vivid-icons
```

Once, the vivid-icons is installed as a node module, go to node_modules/vivid-icons directory using `cd node_modules/vivid-icons` command and install **vivid-icons dependencies** with `npm install`.

### Customize Icons
Go to `src` directory of the installed package and open `config.js` file.

#### `config.js` file looks like
```javascript
export let iconConfig = { 
    size: "48", 
    primaryColor: "#FF6E6E", 
    accentColor: "#0C0058", 
    propColor: "#FFFFFF" 
 } 
```
Update the respective property values which needs to be changed.

### Compile Vivid.JS Icons
Once you are done with updates in `config.js` head back to the terminal and run the following command -
```cli
npm run build
```

### Voila! You're done
Once the compilation process is over, your browser will fire up to show the compiled Vivid SVG Icons in your browser from the `./dist/preview.html` file.

**If you are using Windows environment replace the `"open-html": "open ./dist/preview.html"` with `"open-html": "show ./dist/preview.html"` in `package.json` file.**

# Adding Icons
If you wish to create your very own Vivid.JS with your custom icons, Follow the steps below -

Once you have [installed Vivid.JS](#install-vividjs-package), `add/replace/remove` the icons from `./icons` directory

Make sure the SVG Icons which has been added must have `vi-primary` and `vi-accent` class to the respective [SVG Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element), so that the colors can be customized later from `src/config.js`.

### Example Code
```html
<svg id="chat" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="48" height="48" viewBox="0 0 48 48">
    <defs>
        <style>
        .vi-primary {

        }

        .vi-accent {
            fill: #070c2b;
        }
        </style>
    </defs>
    <path class="vi-primary" d="M24,39.765A18.556,18.556,0,0,1,13.924,37.1L7,44V23.882l0.012,0.006C7.011,23.791,7,23.7,7,23.6,7,14.369,13.247,8,24,8s17,6.652,17,15.882S34.753,39.765,24,39.765Z"/>
